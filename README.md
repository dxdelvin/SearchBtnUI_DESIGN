# Animated Search Bar

This project showcases an animated search bar with a unique design and interactive features. The search bar allows users to input a search query and performs a Google search when the "Search" button is clicked. Additionally, it includes a loading animation that dynamically adjusts the blur and opacity, providing a visually appealing experience.

## Features

- **Animated Search Bar:** The search bar expands and contracts smoothly when activated and deactivated, providing an interactive and visually appealing experience.

- **Custom Loading Animation:** A loading animation with a dynamic blur effect and fading text is displayed when the search is initiated, adding a modern touch to the user interface.

- **Google Search Integration:** Users can enter a search query, and the application will redirect to Google with the entered query when the "Search" button is clicked.
